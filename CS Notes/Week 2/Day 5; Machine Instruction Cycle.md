# Machine Instruction Cycle
#Topic2 #ComputerArchitecture

The machine instruction cycle describes the cycle in which the computer operates. The clock speed is what manages the speed at which this cycle occurs.

1. Fetch (Memory)
2. Decode (CU)
3. Execute (ALU)
4. Store (Memory)

- Computer prrograms are stored in memory as instructions in machine code (binary)
- These instructions and any other data will have to moved from the primary memory to the CPU for proccessing.

## Four steps of the machine cycle
1.  **Fetch** - Retrieve an instruction from memory.
2.  **Decode** - Translate the retrieved instruction into computer commands.
3.  **Execute** - Execute the computer commands.
4.  **Store** - Send and write the results back in memory.

### Example:
1.  The computer user enters a math problem that's stored in memory. The computer fetches that instruction from memory.
2.  The control unit decodes that math problem into instructions the computer understands.
3.  The ALU executes the instructions to get the answer to the math problem.
4.  The problem's answer is sent to and stored in memory where it can be accessed and displayed to the user.
