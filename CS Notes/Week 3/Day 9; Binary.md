Taken from  [[Day 1]]
- "[The] binary number system, in mathematics, [is a] positional numeral system employing 2 as the base and so requiring only two different symbols for its digits, 0 and 1, instead of the usual 10 different symbols needed in the decimal system. The numbers from 0 to 10 are thus in binary 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, and 1010." Britannica
- To convert 00001101 to decimal we follow this process:
$$=(0)128+(0)64+(0)32+0(16)+(1)8+(1)4+(0)2+1(1)$$$$=8+4+1$$$$=13$$
- Binary is the language that computers communicate in. This is because the transitors within a computer can only reliabley understand on/off or low/high voltage.
